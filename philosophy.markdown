tagline: We were founded on a strong belief in a set of business principles that guide
  us in our work. These principles allow us to be free of the potential conflicts
  of interest created within large, multi-product financial institutions.

bullets:
- title: Integrity
  tagline: Objective Advice with a Long-Term Perspective
  text: CINCOPA always strives for what is best for its clients and this is the root
    of our success. We always recommend strategies that only we ourselves would pursue
    were it our company or business. If we don't believe the project meets the standard
    we will advise against it.
- title: Respect
  tagline: Senior Level Attention and Experience
  text: We believe that every project is important - no matter the size. CINCOPA
    provides the time, attention and participation of its Senior Management in all
    aspects of client interaction. From the initial evaluation phase to the final
    execution stage you will have a senior member of the management team directly
    involved in every transaction.
- title: Trust
  tagline: Transaction Execution Experience
  text: CINCOPA takes on each business relationship and project with the imagination
    and creativity required and assures realistic and practical advice. We possess
    significant execution experience from bulge bracket investment banks. Companies
    trust us with some of the most important and complicated mergers, acquisitions,
    sale processes, divestitures and restructurings.
- title: Impartiality
  tagline: Independence and Confidentiality
  text: We always remain impartial and uphold our client's confidence. CINCOPA
    does not underwrite securities, publish securities research, or act as a lender.
    This enables us to avoid the potential conflicts that may arise in larger, more
    diversified companies. In addition, the smaller size of our company enables us
    to provide clients with strict confidentiality at all times.
